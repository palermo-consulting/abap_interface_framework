# SAP HR Interface Framework written in ABAP for SAP ECC 6.0 on-premise
This is a framework for building interfaces in SAP HR by using a change table.  When reading the table definition files (.tbl), note that sections that have tab-delimited lines, such as when definining the fields in the Fields tab of se11, can easily be copied and pasted into Excel to see a clearer view.  In this repository, definition files are only in ascii/text format.  
The program to display the change table is in the change_table/display folder.  
The program to delete line items in the change table is in the change_table/delete folder.
